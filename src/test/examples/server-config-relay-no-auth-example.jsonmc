   * to a remote server without any authentication.
   *
   * Use case: Creating a simple proxy server, testing against APIs that don't require
   * authentication, or when authentication is handled separately.

   *
   * The relay will:
   * 1. Match the incoming request path against relay prefixes
   * 2. Forward the request (method, path, headers, body) to the matching relay's remote URL
   * 3. Add any custom headers from the matching relay's headers
   * 4. Return the response from the remote server
   *
   * Multiple relays can be configured with different prefixes. The longest matching
   * prefix will be used.
   *
   * No OAuth2 authentication will be performed since tokenUrl, clientId, and
   * clientSecret are not provided.
